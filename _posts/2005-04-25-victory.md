> A groundbreaking agreement improving workers&#8217; rights at Washington University was finalized Friday, April 22 ending the 19-day sit-in by members of Washington University&#8217;s Student Worker Alliance (SWA). The Wash. U. sit-in was the second longest sit-in in the recent history of the student movement!
> 
> The agreement includes:<ul type=disc> 
> 
>   * Commitment of at least **$1 million** in the next two years towards salary and benefits for lower-paid contract employees, a significant step **towards a Living Wage** for those workers,
>   * Membership for the University in the **Workers Rights Consortium**, which ensures factories producing clothing and other goods bearing college and university names respect the basic rights of workers,
>   * The formation of a joint student-University committee with SWA representation to **improve University policies so they &#8220;better meet the needs of lower-paid service workers&#8221; ** which includes protecting freedom of association and working towards living wages and benefits for all workers who are directly and indirectly employed by the university.</ul>
