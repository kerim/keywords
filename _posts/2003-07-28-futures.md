I think Tom and the senators quoted in the article adequately describe the horrible stupidity, arrogance, and insensitivity of this plan. Instead, I would like to focus on <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.darpa.mil/', 'DARPA&#8217;s']);" >DARPA&#8217;s</a> own justification for the program:

Huh? Futures markets have &#8220;proven themselves to be good at predicting such things&#8230;&#8221;? Since when? Since when have markets proven themselves good at predicting anything? I&#8217;m no economist, but I know that there exists a large body of material on the irrationality of markets. Look at the 90s for god&#8217;s sakes. I would be much more comfortable if our national defense was based on the I-Ching, or Ifa Divination &#8211; but markets!? This is just crazy.

Look at their picture:

This says it all. I mean, who would even consider using &#8220;polls of experts&#8221; as a way of predicting attacks on the US? How about &#8220;intelligence&#8221;? How about a knowledge of history and of world politics? How about actually learning something about the language and culture of the people in places where we know terrorist threats are likely to come from? How about the fact that we actually were warned about 9-11 but never acted on that knowledge?

Economist one: &#8220;Look &#8211; there&#8217;s a $50 bill on the sidewalk&#8221; Economist two: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid, if it was somebody would have picked it up already&#8221; I reckon that&#8217;s about the predictive power of this initiative.
