On MacOSX you can customize the icons for just about anything. Here are the custom icons for two of the folders I use most regularly:

<img src="http://keywords.oxus.net/images/foldericons.jpg" height="203" width="214" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Folder Icons" title="Foldericons" />

<div id="themify_builder_content-1930" class="themify_builder_content themify_builder themify_builder_front">
</div>

<!-- /themify_builder_content -->
