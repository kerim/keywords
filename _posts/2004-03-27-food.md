Everything in Taiwan is about food &#8211; <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/03/27/2003107925" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/03/27/2003107925', 'even politics']);" >even politics</a>:

> With the pan-blue camp&#8217;s post-election protests going into their sixth day, some Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supporters have begun urging people to attend the rallies &#8212; and eat the free food being served there to protesters.
> 
> In a widely circulated e-mail, DPP supporters asked recipients to fight &#8220;black gold&#8221; by eating as much of the pan-blue camp&#8217;s free food as possible.
> 
> &#8230;The e-mails includes descriptions of the food available at the rallies.
> 
> &#8220;In addition to three square meals a day, you can expect snacks, including instant noodles and steamed buns. The box lunches that are being distributed contain mostly either chicken or pork,&#8221; one e-mail reported.

UPDATE: Photos of KMT food being eaten by DPP supporters (thanks to H.H.!!!):
