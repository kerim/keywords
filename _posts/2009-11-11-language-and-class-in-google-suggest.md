    So it seems that Google offers very different suggestions for search inquiries with slightly different wording. &#8220;Is it wrong to&#8221; suggests &#8220;is it wrong to sleep with your cousin&#8221; whereas &#8220;is it ethical to&#8221; suggests &#8220;is it ethical to sell customer information.&#8221; Some of these differences might be topical, but others seem to betray subtle class differences in the language of search queries.
