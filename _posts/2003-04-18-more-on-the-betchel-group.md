>   It appears that the Betchel Group , recent recipient of a lucrative government contract to rebuild Iraq, has a history in the region . In the 50s, they built a pipeline from Kirkuk in Iraq to Syria, and in the &#8217;80s they had plans to build a massive oil pipeline from iraq to Jordan. And who was the point man in negotations on that latter (unrealized) project? Why, a fellow by the name of Donald Rumsfeld. But remember, only America-hating loons think oil (sorry, Glenn, I mean &#8220;oooooooil&#8221;) might have anything to do with this.
