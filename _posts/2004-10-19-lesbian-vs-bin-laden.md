> The media has devoted enormous attention to Senator John Kerry&#8217;s reference to Mary Cheney, Vice President Dick Cheney&#8217;s daughter, as a lesbian during the <a href="http://debates.org/pages/trans2004d.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://debates.org/pages/trans2004d.html', 'October 13 presidential debate']);" >October 13 presidential debate</a>. Yet President George W. Bush&#8217;s false claim from that same debate &#8212; &#8220;I just don&#8217;t think I ever said I&#8217;m not worried about Osama bin Laden&#8221; &#8212; has received less than half as much media attention. (Bush&#8217;s debate claim is false because he said of bin Laden on March 13, 2002: &#8220;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020313-8.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020313-8.html', 'I&#8217;m truly not that concerned about him.']);" >I&#8217;m truly not that concerned about him.</a>&#8220;)

> A Nexis search by Media Matters for America for coverage of Kerry&#8217;s remark produced 364 hits. A Nexis search for coverage of Bush&#8217;s claim produced only 135 hits. A Nexis search for only the candidates&#8217; key quotations &#8212; &#8220;I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney&#8217;s daughter, who is a lesbian&#8221; versus &#8220;I just don&#8217;t think I ever said I&#8217;m not worried about Osama bin Laden&#8221; &#8212; produced an even sharper imbalance: 156 to 40.
