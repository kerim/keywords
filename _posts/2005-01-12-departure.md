Some random observations from the trip as we prepare to depart from India&#8230;

Conversation on a street corner:

> Stranger: Hello sir, what country?
> 
> Me: America.
> 
> Stranger: Congratulations.

Conversation at a hotel restaurant (on the third night eating there):

> Shashwati: Please don&#8217;t use so much oil tonight.
> 
> Cook: Madame, we use only the finest quality oil.

I had many similar confusions trying to refuse caffinated beverages.

> Host: Would you like some tea?
> 
> Me: No thanks, I don&#8217;t drink caffine.
> 
> Host: Coffee?
> 
> Me: (Shake my head.)
> 
> Shashwati: He doesn&#8217;t drink any caffine &#8211; no tea, no coffee.
> 
> Host: Coke?

I can&#8217;t quote the conversation with the rickshaw driver we hired on several occasions to take us to <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2005/01/07/dnt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2005/01/07/dnt/', 'Chharanagar']);" >Chharanagar</a>, because it was in Hindi, but he basically tried to tell us not to go there because &#8220;they are all crooks there.&#8221; He tried to cheat us on the fare&#8230;

Some observations:

  * No assigned seats on domestic flights is a bad thing.
  * Using biodegradable clay cups instead of plastic is a good thing.
  * Burning all your garbage (including plastic) is a bad thing.
  * Having things fixed (by a tailor or shoe repair man, etc.) instead of throwing them away is a good thing.
  * Review mirrors mounted on the outside of a car don&#8217;t last long in India.
