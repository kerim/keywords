> 
> The local  people of Kashipur have resisted the intrusion of multinational mining corporations  for the last thirteen years.  They have resisted through peaceful and democratic means, withstanding lathi charge, jailings, beatings, and police firings.  But the multinational corporates and their local agents in the administration are trying to  proceed by any hook and crook available,  undermining all democratic processes.   
>    
> Send faxes to oppose this fraud of public process highlighting the fundamental illegality of the project (sample fax letter included below).  
>    
> Project is Illegal because:  
> • Land acquisition from local people has proceeded through manipulation, intimidation and coercion  
> • Project is coming up on 5th Schedule lands where a constitutional guarantee against diversion of tribal land to non-tribals applies.  
> • Affected Gram Sabha’s have submitted resolutions in opposition to the project in 1995 and again in 2000  
> • Environmental Clearances were given in 1995 and lapsed in 2000.  Any work at the site from 2000 till today is illegal because it was carried out without Environmental Clearance.
> 
> Public Hearing is Fraud because:  
> • How can there be a public hearing for &#8220;expansion&#8221; of a project, when the original Environmental Clearances of the project lapsed five years ago!
