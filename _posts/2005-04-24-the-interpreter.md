I honestly don&#8217;t remember much about Colin Pine. He was a classmate of mine at <a href="http://ccms.ntu.edu.tw/~iclp/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ccms.ntu.edu.tw/~iclp/', 'ICLP']);" >ICLP</a> in Taipei, where I studied Chinese for a year. Studying Chinese was such a difficult and intense experience for me that I didn&#8217;t have much time to socialize with my fellow classmates, but Colin was one of those outgoing people who made learning a foreign language look easy. If I recall correctly, he had lived in Taiwan for a few years before starting at ICLP, and already had a wide network of Taiwanese friends outside of the program.

Now Colin is going to be famous.

A new film about NBA legend <a href="http://www.yaoming.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.yaoming.net/', 'Yao Ming']);" >Yao Ming</a> <a href="http://china.yaoming.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://china.yaoming.net/', '姚明']);" >姚明</a>, entitled *<a href="http://www.yearoftheyao.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.yearoftheyao.com/', 'The Year of the Yao']);" >The Year of the Yao</a>*, focuses on the relationship between the basketball player and his interpreter. And his interpreter is none other than Colin Pine.

In a <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2005/04/21/peking-man/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2005/04/21/peking-man/', 'recent post']);" >recent post</a> about Chinese attitudes towards race, I mentioned that Chinese attitudes towards African-Americans were different from those held regarding Africans. Basketball has a lot to do with this. Basketball was huge in mainland China when I visited in 1990, I&#8217;m sure its popularity has only grown since then. It seems like a lot of the film&#8217;s humor revolves around

> Yao&#8217;s unique and hilarious relationship with his new African-American teammates, complete with jokes about Chinese and Soul food (with requisite comic revulsion at eating fish heads, Yao&#8217;s first Thanksgiving turkey, and the surreptitious serving of snake to an unsuspecting teammate).

Sounds kinda boring and clichéd to me, but I might end up seeing the film just to contemplate the very different career path I might have had after finishing my Chinese studies!
