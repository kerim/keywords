> Without the Afghans much of the development of the outback would have been very difficult if not impossible. Whole communities, towns, mining establishments, pastoral properties and some well known explorations in the interior have been made successful because of their contributions.

The same site has<a href="http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/ghan.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/ghan.htm', ' a page on the train line']);" > a page on the train line</a> as well.
