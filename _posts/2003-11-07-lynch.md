Anyone riding the subway in NY city noticed the difference in how papers covered the announcement of Jessica Lynch&#8217;s new book about her rescue from Iraq. I couldn&#8217;t find images of the actual cover pages of the local papers, but here are screen captures of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/07/national/07LYNC.html?ex=1068872400&#38;" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/07/national/07LYNC.html?ex=1068872400&', 'NY Times']);" >NY Times</a> and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/134264p-119598c.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/134264p-119598c.html', 'Daily News']);" >Daily News</a> coverage of the announcement:

Now, I covered this story extensively during the war. When she first was missing, I discussed the fact that she joined the military because she <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1135" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1135', 'couldn&#8217;t find a job in her hometown']);" >couldn&#8217;t find a job in her hometown</a>. When she was rescued I discussed the history of <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1172" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1172', 'orientalist fantasies about &#8220;white slavery&#8221; ']);" >orientalist fantasies about &#8220;white slavery&#8221; </a>that I felt informed much of the media coverage. Then it turned out that the doctors were actually <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1222" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1222', 'quite nice to Pvt. Lynch']);" >quite nice to Pvt. Lynch</a>. And that the rescue was <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1290" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1290', 'filmed like a Hollywood action movie']);" >filmed like a Hollywood action movie</a>. And that the military <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1328" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1328', 'smashed the windows']);" >smashed the windows</a> when they could have used the key. The whole story was then quite <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1349" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1349', 'exhaustively reported in the Washington Post']);" >exhaustively reported in the Washington Post</a> who went back and interviewed many of the doctors.

So why am I not surprised to read that Iraqi doctors <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;u=/ap/iraq_jessica_lynch" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/iraq_jessica_lynch', 'dismiss the rape claims']);" >dismiss the rape claims</a>?


>   Dr. Mahdi Khafazji, an orthopedic surgeon at Nasiriyah&#8217;s main hospital performed surgery on Lynch to repair a fractured femur and said he found no signs that she was raped or sodomized. 
>   
>   
>     Khafazji, speaking at his private clinic in Nasiriyah, said he examined her extensively and would have detected signs of sexual assault. He said the examination turned up no trace of semen.
