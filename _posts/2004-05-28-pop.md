Forget NASCAR moms, single Dads, disgruntled soccer players and other swing voting blocks. What we want is the &#8220;pop&#8221; vote! Those who say &#8220;soda&#8221; seem to be solid Democratic supporters, with the &#8220;coke&#8221; crowd going Republican (I guess this is shown by their willingness to use a corporate trademark as a generic term), and a lot of the swing states either saying &#8220;pop&#8221; or displaying some clear confusion about where their soda-pop-coke allegiances lie.

Here is a map showing the distribution of soda (green) vs. coke (red) and pop (blue) &#8211; notice how swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Missouri show a fairly even pop/soda split, and swing state New Mexico has a lot of speakers who fall in the &#8220;other&#8221; category (Spanish?):

Here are the results from the 2000 election:

To be fair, it does look like many people had the same idea independently. For instance, <a href="http://irisheagle.blogspot.com/2004/05/you-say-soda.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://irisheagle.blogspot.com/2004/05/you-say-soda.html', 'Irish Eagle']);" >Irish Eagle</a> wrote this on the 25th, three days before my post:

> One last thing, compare this map with the electoral map from 2000 by county. They&#8217;re not identical, but there&#8217;s a general trend for Bush voters to say &#8220;pop&#8221; or &#8220;coke&#8221; and Gore voters to say &#8221; soda&#8221;. Don&#8217;t know what that might mean.
