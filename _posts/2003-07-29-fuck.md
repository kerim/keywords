There goes my site&#8217;s &#8220;G&#8221; rating! Probably means you won&#8217;t be able to visit my site from a school or public library web site anymore! Oh well&#8230;

The Smoking Gun&#8217;s 2003 <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/archive/fword1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thesmokinggun.com/archive/fword1.html', 'Legal Document of the Year Award']);" >Legal Document of the Year Award</a> goes to a zealous public defender:


>   The boy&#8217;s troubles started when he was confronted at school by a vice principal who suspected that he had been smoking in the boys bathroom. When presented to the principal, the kid exploded, cursing the administrator with some variants of the &#8220;F&#8221; word. &#8230; Faced with what he thought was a speech crime, Eric Vanatta, the teen&#8217;s public defender, drafted the below motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charge. The District Court document is an amusing and profane look at the world&#8217;s favorite four-letter word, from its origins in 1500 to today&#8217;s frequent use of the term by Eminem, Chris Rock, and Lenny Kravitz.


I can&#8217;t easily quote the document itself because it is presented as a series of 9 image files. Hopefully someone will make it all machine readable, I don&#8217;t have time&#8230; But it is fun reading. Personally I find the student&#8217;s use of another &#8220;f-word&#8221; to refer to the administrator&#8217;s sexual orientation much more offensive than his using &#8220;fuck.&#8221; I remember one or two instances where I cursed at my teachers in junior high school. One time a teacher was trying to force me to continue to rock climb (he was holding the rope) even though my arms lacked the strength to go any further. Only when I started cursing at him did he let me down. He was upset, but certainly didn&#8217;t press any charges!

In a separate, but related story, Talk Left reports that some states are starting to <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003834.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003834.html', 'make people pay']);" >make people pay</a> for their public defender!

And of course, there is another &#8220;<a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000026.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000026.html', 'F-word']);" >F-word</a>&#8221; I&#8217;ve been arguing everyone should be using a little more.

UPDATE: Here is the entry in the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuck" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuck', 'Wikipedia']);" >Wikipedia</a> referenced in the court documents.
