Up till now I&#8217;ve resisted putting a &#8220;donate&#8221; button on my site. But the fact is that I now have over 500 people a day visiting the site and if out of all those readers I got $11 a month the site would be self-supporting.

As an added incentive to give even more money, I am promising to donate all money in excess of this year&#8217;s web hosting fees to <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2005/01/15/andaman-and-nicobar-islands/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2005/01/15/andaman-and-nicobar-islands/', 'supporting tsunami victims']);" >supporting tsunami victims</a> in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This way you can both support my blogging and support tsunami victims as well!
