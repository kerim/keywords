*Question*: When is an Arab not an Arab?

*Answer*: <a href="http://abuaardvark.typepad.com/abuaardvark/2004/02/arabs_for_bush.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://abuaardvark.typepad.com/abuaardvark/2004/02/arabs_for_bush.html', 'When its a story in the New York Times']);" >When its a story in the New York Times</a>.

I used to have a ritual of buying the Sunday Times, but <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16922" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16922', 'the reporting has gotten so bad']);" >the reporting has gotten so bad</a> (more <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2095394/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2095394/', 'here']);" >here</a>) that I can&#8217;t even do that anymore. Sure, there are still <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000319.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000319.html', 'some good reporters']);" >some good reporters</a> working there &#8211; it is a large organization. But I would rather not have to spend my Sunday separating the wheat from the chafe. It is much more efficient to <a href="http://www.cursor.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cursor.org/', 'let the blogsphere do it for me']);" >let the blogsphere do it for me</a>, even if it means I spend Sunday morning at the computer instead of on the couch.

(via <a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/fact_checker_pl.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/fact_checker_pl.html', 'Body and Soul']);" >Body and Soul</a>.)

UPDATE: As T.F. points out in the comments, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/18/pageoneplus/corrections.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/18/pageoneplus/corrections.html', 'NY Times made ammends']);" >NY Times made ammends</a> for the faulty headline. But Body and Soul points us to <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2095636/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2095636/', 'this analysis in Slate']);" >this analysis in Slate</a>, which makes it clear that much more is wrong with this article than just the headline.
