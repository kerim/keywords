The Palm Treo is a decent device, but it costs twice what it should and it hasn&#8217;t been <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/21/dear-palm-its-time-for-an-intervention" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/21/dear-palm-its-time-for-an-intervention', 'significantly upgraded']);" >significantly upgraded</a> in years. Unfortunately, I need one. I need one because I dearly depend upon my <a href="http://pleco.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pleco.com/', 'Pleco Chinese-English dictionary']);" >Pleco Chinese-English dictionary</a>, which I use several times a day. I also need one because my Treo 650 suddenly died on me a few weeks ago. I *could* use a Windows Mobile device, but the idea of my cell phone <a href="http://www.smstextnews.com/2007/06/tired_of_dissing_windows_mobile_i_emailed_htc_for_help.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.smstextnews.com/2007/06/tired_of_dissing_windows_mobile_i_emailed_htc_for_help.html', 'crashing']);" >crashing</a> on me twice a day isn&#8217;t very appealing. But here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; buying a new Treo in Taiwan would cost me over $500! That&#8217;s more than an iPhone, and nobody&#8217;s going tell me that a Treo is worth as much as an iPhone, even if the iPhone doesn&#8217;t have a Chinese dictionary.

So what am I to do? I did the same thing I did when I bought my Treo 650 two years ago &#8211; I bought a used one on eBay. It costs less than one third the price of a new one in Taiwan, even with shipping.

There&#8217;s only one catch. It turns out that you can&#8217;t ship cell phones to Taiwan. Nobody will stop you if you come in by plane, but if its in a box forget about it. Not only do you have to spend hundreds of dollars to get it cleared through customs, but the paperwork alone is a huge pain in the ass. Turns out I can&#8217;t return it to the US either. Returning it to the US would have cost more than I paid for the item.

So Taiwanese customs will dispose of my Treo &#8230;

But guess what! All of a sudden, and just as inexplicably as it started, my Treo started working again.

Maybe it will stay working long enough till I can get an <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2007/06/28/jesusphone/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2007/06/28/jesusphone/', 'Jesusphone']);" >Jesusphone</a> in Taiwan &#8230; or at least a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/25/latest-palm-centro-leaked-shot-looks-official" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/25/latest-palm-centro-leaked-shot-looks-official', 'Centro']);" >Centro</a>. (Unfortunately, the same day the Treo came back alive, Shashwati&#8217;s cell phone which I was using as a backup died. Who knows?)

UPDATE: Maybe I jinxed myself by writing this post. My Treo died again immediately upon posting &#8230;
