>   &#8220;Taiwan&#8217;s Transportation and Communication Ministry has said that cellular phone penetration in the country has passed the 100% mark. With 22.6 million cellphones in use in the country, and a total population of 22.3 million the penetration level has reached 100.7%. Considering that just over 20% of the population is under the age of 14, a fair number of Taiwanese must have more than one phone each.</p>
