I&#8217;ve been very happy with my <a href="http://www.oxusnet.net/amazon/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.oxusnet.net/amazon/index.html', 'Amazon RSS Feed Generator']);" >Amazon RSS Feed Generator</a>. It has alerted me to quite a few new books coming out on topics that I&#8217;m interested in. The only frustrating thing is that many of them are not yet in print, so I have to wait!

Now I just discovered a site that does something similar for eBay searches. The <a href="http://www.ebaygeeks.com/desktopmodules/ebaygeeks/ebay2rss.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ebaygeeks.com/desktopmodules/ebaygeeks/ebay2rss.aspx', 'eBay2RSS feed generator']);" >eBay2RSS feed generator</a> will generate a feed from a simple eBay search, but it also allows you to go into eBay, generate a URL for a complex search, and use that to generate your feed. So if your looking for a bargain on something special, this is the way to go!

Although I should add that the Amazon RSS Feed Generator will also work with Amazon zShops if you are a serious bargain hunter. [
