It seems conservative commentators are labeling anyone who criticizes the right as an anti-Semite:

He is correct to point out that this should be &#8220;roundly and vociferously criticized.&#8221; But it is a strategy that has worked so well for right wing supporters of Israel that I suppose the neoconservatives felt it was worth a try. It is unfortunate because the problem of anti-Semitism is both wide spread and real, and these misuses make the term ineffective where it is really needed.
