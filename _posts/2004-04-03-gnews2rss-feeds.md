Very cool. Although, it seems that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/04/02/google_news_which_sc.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/04/02/google_news_which_sc.html', 'Google doesn&#8217;t like it']);" >Google doesn&#8217;t like it</a> &#8211; at least not when people post the results of such searches to their web site. It should be OK for personal use. If you have your own server, downloading the script and installing it is trivially easy. [
