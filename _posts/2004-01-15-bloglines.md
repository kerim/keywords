It is hard to explain to people who aren&#8217;t computer savvy just <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000246.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000246.html', 'what an RSS feed is']);" >what an RSS feed is</a>, and why it is good for them to know. So, instead, I&#8217;ve set up <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/myblogs" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloglines.com/myblogs', 'a public account over at Bloglines']);" >a public account over at Bloglines</a> (to log in, use the e-mail address: &#8220;bloglines@spamhole.com&#8221;, and the password: &#8220;keywords&#8221;), an online RSS feed reader. *Please*, take the time to log in to this account and click on &#8220;my blogs&#8221;. You&#8217;ll see a window with a list of web sites on the left, and a pane on the right where individual news stories are displayed. You&#8217;ll see exactly how programs like <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/8394" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/8394', 'NetNewsWire']);" >NetNewsWire</a> and <a href="http://www.feedreader.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.feedreader.com/', 'Feedreader']);" >Feedreader</a> work.

For people who have their own Bloglines account, I&#8217;ve added a quick subscribe link in the Keywords &#8220;syndication&#8221; menu bar.
