>   &#8220;Since the late 1990&#8217;s, Nigerian movies have found a place next to offerings from Hollywood and Bollywood, Bombay&#8217;s equivalent, in the cities, towns and villages across English-speaking Africa. Though made on the cheap, with budgets of about only $15,000, the Nigerian movies have become huge hits, with stories, themes and faces familiar to other Africans. It is now, according to conservative estimates, a $45 million a year industry.&#8221;
