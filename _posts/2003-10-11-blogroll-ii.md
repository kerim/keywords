I&#8217;ve once <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000077.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000077.html', 'again']);" >again</a> changed how I do my blogroll. Now there are far more sites listed in the menu on the right of this site. Scroll down to see. I did it using<a href="http://people.etango.com/~markm/archives/2003/10/08/easy_movable_type_blogrolls.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://people.etango.com/~markm/archives/2003/10/08/easy_movable_type_blogrolls.html', ' a neat trick I found']);" > a neat trick I found</a> which makes it very easy to add more blogs. So if you have suggestions for new blogs to add to my list, let me know in the comments. And if I&#8217;ve linked to you, perhaps you&#8217;d return the favor?

**UPDATE**: <a href="http://people.etango.com/~markm/archives/2003/10/12/easy_movabletype_blogroll_part_ii.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://people.etango.com/~markm/archives/2003/10/12/easy_movabletype_blogroll_part_ii.html', 'Here is an update to the &#8220;neat trick&#8221;']);" >Here is an update to the &#8220;neat trick&#8221;</a>.
