Here is a small sample of the larger picture (click to see the whole thing):

The artist, Danny Gregory, also has a nice <a href="http://www.dannygregory.com/weblog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dannygregory.com/weblog/', 'blog']);" >blog</a>.

Also, I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog this list of &#8220;<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bradamant/84830.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.livejournal.com/users/bradamant/84830.html', 'weirdos you meet on the subway']);" >weirdos you meet on the subway</a>&#8221; for some time now. Number 8 is one that has been bothering me a lot lately:

> 8. *The Ringtone-Tester*. This is a young person who has just purchased a fancy new cellphone. Although there is no reception in the subway tunnels, they have turned on the phone so that they can try all 99 ringtones it came with. The phone starts out beebling &#8220;DEEDLE-EEDLE-EET!&#8221; goes through &#8220;Eine Kleine Nachtmusik&#8221; and that obscure, cult hit &#8220;Hey Ya!&#8221; to various ballistic sound effects. He or she has to go through the list at least twice before committing to a ringtone.

We don&#8217;t get much of number 10 on the 7 train.
