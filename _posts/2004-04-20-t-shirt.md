It seems that there are three major factors leading to the widespread <a href="http://wearablesbusiness.com/mag/apparel_brief_history_tshirt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wearablesbusiness.com/mag/apparel_brief_history_tshirt/', 'popularity of the T-Shirt']);" >popularity of the T-Shirt</a>: war, Hollywood, and *politics*.

> According to *The T-Shirt Book* by noted screenprinting industry expert Scott Fresener, the beginning of the T-shirt is credited to the navy.
> 
> No one, says Fresener, really knows when the first T-shirt was produced. But the U.S. Navy adopted a crew-necked, short-sleeved, white cotton undershirt as issue to be worn under a jumper as early as 1913.

But it wasn&#8217;t until the thirties that both private companies (such as Sears) and the Navy started to make T-shirts that were suitable to be worn as outer garments. Even though T-shirts were standard issue for soldiers in World War Two, it was Hollywood that made T-shirts cool:

> &#8230;movie stars such as Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire), James Dean (Rebel Without a Cause) and a young Elvis Presley made the T-shirt-as-outerwear sexy.

Considering that *Streetcar* was made in 1951, and Brando&#8217;s shirt was blank except for his sweat, it seems that New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey was way ahead of hist time when his presidential campaign became the <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m1346/5_48/101173125/print.jhtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m1346/5_48/101173125/print.jhtml', 'first advertising campaign']);" >first advertising campaign</a> in history to use printed T-shirts:

> The T-shirt is also a tabula rasa that for Decades has been turning its wearers into living, breathing billboards. The first T-shirt to serve this function was produced during the 1948 presidential race between Harry Truman and Thomas Dewey and read DEW-IT WITH DEWEY. Soon after, Anheuser-Busch became the first company to use T-shirts to sell a product.

Unfortunately, John <a href="http://www.kerrygear.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&#38;Store_Code=KG&#38;Category_Code=SHIRTS" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kerrygear.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=KG&Category_Code=SHIRTS', 'Kerry&#8217;s T-shirts']);" >Kerry&#8217;s T-shirts</a> are far less adventurous than those of Dewey.
