Well, I didn&#8217;t realize how <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004770.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004770.php', 'much of a distraction']);" >much of a distraction</a> it really was:
