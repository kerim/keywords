> You have made it clear in the past that, unlike the previous Indonesian administration, you do not believe a military solution can be found to this long and devastating conflict, in which serious human rights abuses have been committed by both sides. You also said after your election that addressing the conflict in Aceh was your highest domestic priority. As Jan Egeland of OCHA and aid agencies are already pointing out, an ongoing war will make it difficult, if not impossible, for genuine reconstruction and development to take place. We believe that the priority now must be mobilizing all government institutions to provide relief and reconstruction.
