>     I don&#8217;t care for the Washington Posts&#8217; use of one inspector&#8217;s leadership in an S&M club as a way of smearing him. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be particularly relavent. The real story was skipped over &#8211; why there were no background checks. Considering the hightened level of security everywhere, why did the US/UN allow this to happen? It seems that part of the reason is simply a lack of funds for the UN. There is a quote which states:
