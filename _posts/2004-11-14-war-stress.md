> In Iraq, counselors are helping U.S. soldiers develop coping skills so that they can handle the stress of combat. But doctors are finding growing anxiety among Iraqi people who see themselves as caught in a helpless situation. <a href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=4169425" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=4169425', 'NPR&#8217;s Emily Harris reports']);" >NPR&#8217;s Emily Harris reports</a>.
