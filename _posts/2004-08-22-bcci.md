> The fact that George W Bush borrowed money from BCCI in 1987 but John Kerry launched the investigation in 1988 that eventually brought them down really <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002361.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002361.html', 'says about all you need to know']);" >says about all you need to know</a> about the character of the two men.

This is exactly what caught my eye when I first looked into <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000353.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000353.html', 'Kerry&#8217;s record']);" >Kerry&#8217;s record</a> back in February &#8211; but now there is <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html', 'a new article']);" >a new article</a> by David Sirota and Jonathan Baskin in the *Washington Monthly* which lays the case out very clearly. As the Republicans continue to make Kerry out to be a flip-flopping lame duck it is important to remember that he was behind one of the most important anti-corruption investigations of the past thirty years, and did so against the interests of some pretty big players in his own party. As the authors say,

> legislation is only one facet of a senator&#8217;s record. As the BCCI investigation shows, Kerry developed a very different record of accomplishment&#8211;one often as vital, if not more so, than passage of bills.

And, as David Corn <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000441.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000441.html', 'pointed out in March']);" >pointed out in March</a>, Kerry&#8217;s legislative record isn&#8217;t all that bad either.
