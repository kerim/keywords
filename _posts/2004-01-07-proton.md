This is the Chinese character for &#8220;proton&#8221; as in what is in the nucleus of an atom, pronounced &#8220;Zhi4zi3&#8243;. But my Chinese dictionary tells me that it has another, historical, meaning:

> <div>
>   A prince sent to a neighboring state as a hostage.
> </div>

Sometimes I really love the Chinese language.

<div id="themify_builder_content-1458" class="themify_builder_content themify_builder themify_builder_front">
</div>

<!-- /themify_builder_content -->
