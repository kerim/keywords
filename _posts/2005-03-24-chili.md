It also found that companies frequently deny workers’ compensation to employees injured on the job, intimidate and fire workers who try to organize, and exploit workers’ immigrant status in order to keep them quiet about abuses.

The reason I point the finger (sorry!) at the meat packing industry is that, according to the article, &#8220;all of the workers at the restaurant were in possession &#8216;of all 10 of their fingers.'&#8221; I assume it was a result of the incredibly high risk of loosing a body part while working in a meat packing plant.
