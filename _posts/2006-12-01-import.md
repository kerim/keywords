Somewhere along the line, as I moved from one blogging platform to another, I lost 15 months worth of blog posts. Because, before I started *Keywords* I used to post much more frequently (my posts were also shorter and contained little original content), that is over 1200 missing posts.

Fortunately, thanks two two very useful scripts (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuc2wp/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuc2wp/', 'Nucleus to WordPress Migrator']);" >Nucleus to WordPress Migrator</a> and <a href="http://www.technosailor.com/wordpress-to-wordpress-import/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.technosailor.com/wordpress-to-wordpress-import/', 'WordPress to WordPress Import']);" >WordPress to WordPress Import</a>), I was able to successfully reimport all of those missing posts into this blog, preserving the original dates. Since any links to my old blog have long since rotted away, I don&#8217;t care that the import failed to preserve the original URLs. More important is that those posts will now be searchable via Google and my own <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/zeitgeist/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/zeitgeist/', 'archives page']);" >archives page</a> (which I also fixed up).

Unfortunately, the posts I imported seem to lack any category association (not even &#8220;unfiled&#8221;). Hopefully I&#8217;ll figure out some fix for that over time. Because my posting style changed so much when I started Keywords, I was originally hesitant to import these into the same blog; however, the simplicity of just maintaining one archive and blog for all my old records makes up for any confusion that might result.
