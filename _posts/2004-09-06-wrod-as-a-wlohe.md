You might have seen this floating around the internet:

> Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn&#8217;t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. 

Needless to say, my recent post about <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/03/bouma/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/03/bouma/', 'word recognition']);" >word recognition</a> debunks that theory pretty clearly. But if you need more proof, take a look at <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/', 'this page']);" >this page</a> by Matt Davis, a researcher at Cambridge:

> This text circulated on the internet in September 2003. I first became aware of it when a journalist contacted a my colleague Sian Miller on 16th September, trying to track down the original source. It&#8217;s been passed on many times, and in the way of most internet memes has mutated along the way. It struck me as interesting &#8211; especially when I received a version that mentioned Cambridge University! I work at Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, in Cambridge, UK, a Medical Research Council unit that includes a large group investigating how the brain processes language. If there&#8217;s a new piece of research on reading that&#8217;s been conducted in Cambridge, I thought I should have heard of it before&#8230;

> I&#8217;ve written this page, to try to explain the science behind this meme. There are elements of truth in this, but also some things which scientists studying the psychology of language (psycholinguists) know to be incorrect. I&#8217;m going to break down the meme, one line at a time to illustrate these points, pointing out what I think is the relevant research on the role of letter order on reading. Again, this is only my view of the current state of reading research, as it relates to this meme.
