OK, <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000017.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000017.html', 'my first post']);" >my first post</a> was actually number 17, so this is only my 83rd post since June 29th. And, of course, I had <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/', 'my old blog']);" >my old blog</a> before that&#8230; but still, I can&#8217;t help but feel that post number 100 has some special significance.

The site does pretty well for a latecomer to the game. I average about 20 visitors a day, only a few of which are here because of random Google searches. A lot more visitors stick around and look at other posts than did so on my own blog, which makes me very happy. And I have an additional 26 people who receive my blog everyday via <a href="http://www.bloglet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloglet.com/', 'Bloglet.com']);" >Bloglet.com</a>. (You can sign up on the right.) Moreover, some individual entries have received considerable attention. The most visited entries are: <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000066.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000066.html', 'Babel']);" >Babel</a>, <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000050.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000050.html', 'Bilingual']);" >Bilingual</a>, <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000040.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000040.html', 'Programs']);" >Programs</a>, <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000026.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000026.html', 'Fascism']);" >Fascism</a>, <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000033.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000033.html', 'Sanctions']);" >Sanctions</a>, <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000036.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000036.html', 'Fuck']);" >Fuck</a>, and <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000096.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000096.html', 'Class']);" >Class</a>.

Google searches leading to my site have recently included &#8220;caesar&#8217;s palace cocktail waitresses&#8221; and &#8220;john sayles&#8217; sexual orientation,&#8221; among other things unrelated to my blog. (Oops, now I&#8217;ll get even more hits for those searches&#8230;). But there are also many searches that actually get people to pages that I think will help them find what they are looking for. Searches for &#8220;tradesports legal&#8221; usually get people to my entries on <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000035.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000035.html', 'Futures']);" >Futures</a> and <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000039.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000039.html', 'Gambling']);" >Gambling</a>, and a fair number of people come looking for information on <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000029.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000029.html', 'Cossacks']);" >Cossacks</a> or the NY Times article by James Traub on <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000026.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000026.html', 'Fascism']);" >Fascism</a>.

On the down side, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?rank=&#38;url=http%3A%2F%2Fkeywords.oxus.net%2F&#38;sub=Get+Link+Cosmos" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?rank=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fkeywords.oxus.net%2F&sub=Get+Link+Cosmos', 'only a few blogs have linked to me']);" >only a few blogs have linked to me</a>, or to entries I wrote here. Still, the ones that do link to me are all excellent blogs, so I&#8217;m flattered that they added me to their blogroll. I really need to update my own blogroll to include more blogs &#8211; rather than <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/bookmarks/view_group.php?id=62" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/bookmarks/view_group.php?id=62', 'linking to other blogs via my bookmarks web page']);" >linking to other blogs via my bookmarks web page</a>. I&#8217;m just waiting for <a href="http://www.lbstone.com/apb/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lbstone.com/apb/', 'my bookmarks software']);" >my bookmarks software</a> to be upgraded.

If you like this blog, please link to it from your own blog, or at least try to link to one of my entries now and then. And if you don&#8217;t have your own blog, at least try to come and leave a comment now and then! (Comments are pretty sparse around here&#8230;) You can start by leaving your thoughts in the comments section right here, on entry #100!
