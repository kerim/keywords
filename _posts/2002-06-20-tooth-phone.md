>   &#8220;A prototype radio device designed to fit inside a human tooth and provide covert mobile phone communications has been created by two UK students.</p> 
>   
>   <p>
>     The device currently consists of a digital radio receiver that converts radio signals into sound and a tiny vibrating component, which conveys sound to the wearer&#8217;s inner ear through bone vibrations.

>     Inventors James Auger and Jimmy Loizeau of the Royal College of Art in London say the tiny receiver could be configured to receive sound from an external device, such as a mobile phone, a radio or a computer.

>     They also say it would be relatively simple to fit the gadget with a microphone, to allow it to return a radio signal to another device.&#8221;
