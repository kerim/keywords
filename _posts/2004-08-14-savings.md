If you start knowing that &#8220;Wealthier people derive more of their income from returns on saving—both in dollar terms and as a proportion of income—than poor people do.&#8221; You can quickly guess what <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2100251" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2100251', 'Bush&#8217;s economic policy']);" >Bush&#8217;s economic policy</a> might be:

> The nation&#8217;s current economic policy came to Washington in care of R. Glenn Hubbard and Lawrence B. Lindsey &#8230;. [They] saw cutting taxes on savings and wealth as a recipe for faster growth. Their plans were consistent with supply-side economics, which had dominated Republican policy for decades, since they targeted the economy&#8217;s long-run potential to grow rather than short-run fine-tuning of demand. But the focus on savings was a departure from earlier conservative doctrine.

The author of the above article in Slate is Daniel Altman, a former member of the *New York Times* editorial board. You can now buy his new book *<a href="http://www.neoconomy.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.neoconomy.net/', 'Neoconomy']);" >Neoconomy</a>*, which

> explains the intellectual origins of the neoconomy; how the White House passed it off as a cure for the stagnation and uncertainty plaguing the nation; how George W. Bush locked the nation onto his chosen path, incurring huge risks while casting the nation deeper into debt; and finally, how the whole gamble might play out: as the neoconomist&#8217;s dream, or the breadwinner&#8217;s nightmare.
