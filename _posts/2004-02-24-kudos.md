> &#8230;a very smart lefty blog that I&#8217;ll definitely be checking in the future.

You know, it doesn&#8217;t take much to make a blogger happy. We don&#8217;t do what we do for money, we don&#8217;t do it for fame, but we do want one thing: the respect of our peers. Thanks!

OK, maybe respect isn&#8217;t enough &#8211; we also want people to read what we write! Ampersand&#8217;s post on <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/001289.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amptoons.com/blog/001289.html', 'how to get more hits']);" >how to get more hits</a> on your site is full of good advice. One thing he doesn&#8217;t mention, however, is the importance of having a working <a href="http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000246.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://keywords.oxus.net/archives/000246.html', 'RSS feed']);" >RSS feed</a> for your site. With so many blogs to keep up with, more and more people are relying upon software like <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/8394" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/8394', 'NetNewsWire']);" >NetNewsWire</a> or <a href="http://www.feedreader.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.feedreader.com/', 'Feedreader']);" >Feedreader</a> (for the PC), as well as online services like <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloglines.com/', 'Bloglines']);" >Bloglines</a>. Unfortunately, a lot of people are blogging with homemade or out-of-date software that doesn&#8217;t provide a working RSS feed. There are some good blogs in my blogroll that I never read for this reason. Similarly, you want blogging software that supports <a href="http://www.muhajabah.com/islamicblog/what-is-tb.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.muhajabah.com/islamicblog/what-is-tb.htm', 'Trackbacks']);" >Trackbacks</a>. This way other bloggers will immediately be notified if you link to their posts. I strongly recommend using <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.movabletype.org/', 'MovableType']);" >MovableType</a> or <a href="http://www.typepad.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.typepad.com/', 'Typepad']);" >Typepad</a>, if you prefer PHP, give <a href="http://www.nucleuscms.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nucleuscms.org/', 'Nucleus']);" >Nucleus</a> a try. If you have a mac, try using <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/index.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/index.php', 'ecto']);" >ecto</a> to write your posts! And don&#8217;t forget to test your site out on a few different browsers and computer systems &#8211; if your site doesn&#8217;t load properly on someone&#8217;s web browser they aren&#8217;t going to read it!

UDPATE: <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp', 'FeedDemon']);" >FeedDemon</a> seems to be a good PC RSS feed reader, although it isn&#8217;t free like FeedReader.
