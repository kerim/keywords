I&#8217;ve completed the design of the new site. I even have a couple of items ready to post. However, I am not going to start using the site until I can make sure that I won&#8217;t leave behind my e-mail subscribers. Unfortunately, the e-mail notification system in Movable Type doesn&#8217;t work the way I want it to. As a result, I may have to go back to using the (unreliable) bloglet service. If Bloglet works tonight then I&#8217;ll sign everyone up at the new site and move things over tomorrow. 

Till then, please help me test the new site! Visit the site and post a comment to the test post letting me know if you notice anything strange about the site design, or if you like it!
