Moreover,

But what happens after being declared a &#8220;failure&#8221;?

So where is that money coming from? It&#8217;s not coming at all:

> <div>
>   Not even the No Child Left Behind Act is getting adequate federal funding. In order for millions of disadvantaged children to pass standardized tests, schools need extra resources to help them along. And schools that fail need extra funding for the mandated tutoring, plus the added costs of transporting students to other schools. But the federal government isn&#8217;t coming up with nearly as much money as it promised when the act was passed. So far, <a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/9/reich-r.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/9/reich-r.html', 'federal appropriations are almost a third less than what was authorized']);" >federal appropriations are almost a third less than what was authorized</a>, about $6 billion under the mark. As a result, a lot of the act&#8217;s cost is falling on the states and cities, which can&#8217;t possibly afford it.
