This is a little late, but I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about the recent MTA fare hike. Actually, unlike previous fare hikes, they didn&#8217;t raise the base fare, which is still $2. Instead, they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/nyregion/26fare.html?ex=1267160400&#038;en=c491ed26846e8ec2&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/nyregion/26fare.html?ex=1267160400&en=c491ed26846e8ec2&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland', 'reduced the discount']);" >reduced the discount</a> for purchasing unlimited-ride MetroCards.

> The cost of a 7-day card will rise to $24 from $21; a 30-day card to $76 from $70; and a 7-day express bus card to $41 from $37. The price of a one-way express bus ride will increase to $5 from $4.

This is only the fifteenth fare increase in the subway&#8217;s 100 year history, but it is the second in two years. It seems the last one didn&#8217;t go so well. When they raised the fares in 2003, what happened was that bargain-savvy New Yorkers simply switched to buying reduced-rate unlimited-ride cards. Because the whole system is now computerized and doesn&#8217;t require retooling every single turnstile, it is now much less costly for them to raise or adjust the fares &#8211; we can expect such adjustments to happen on a much more frequent basis.

But we shouldn&#8217;t take these fare increases lying down. First of all, as some may remember, when the 2003 fare increase was announced it was justified because of a $236 million deficit; however, it turned out that the MTA was keeping double books, and &#8220;<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/local/story/83759p-76585c.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/news/local/story/83759p-76585c.html', 'it could have shown a $83 million surplus']);" >it could have shown a $83 million surplus</a> for [that] year.&#8221; I&#8217;m still not sure why the fare increase was finally allowed to stand, but it seems strange that nobody is raising a ruckus <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/284738p-243928c.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/284738p-243928c.html', 'when the MTA claims that']);" >when the MTA claims that</a> it

> needs to come up with $600 million to balance the books, with annual deficits rising to $1 billion in 2008, according to current projections.

Right, and I have a bridge in Brooklyn I&#8217;d like to sell you!

On a side note, I was surprised by two things in the following graphic: First, that ridership declines after each fare increase. This may not be surprising to some &#8211; but it always seemed to me that if people are taking the subway or the bus somewhere they don&#8217;t really have much of a choice. Do people just stay home? And secondly, it shocked me to see that ridership is only now catching up with its peak in the 1950s. I would have assumed it had been steadily growing ever since then &#8211; but I suppose it was just after the war that people started buying cars, so that must explain much of the initial drop; but then it continued to decline, or remain low, even during the oil crisis in the 70s&#8230;
