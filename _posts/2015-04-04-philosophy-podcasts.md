One of the joys of being on sabbatical has been time to read and study philosophy. Equipped with my Bose [QuietComfort 20i](http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort_20/index.jsp) noise cancelling headphones I can clearly hear podcasts as I walk Juno around the streets and riverside parks of Taipei. So far I've listend to the following:

- Both semesters of Hubert Dreyfus' course on Heiddeger. 
  - You can get the first semester [here](https://archive.org/details/Philosophy_185_Fall_2007_UC_Berkeley), but the second one is only available via iTunes.
- ... lectures on Heidgegger
- ... lectures on Hegel

I've long enjoyed the Philosophy Bites podcast, and I'm also planning on litening to the ... without gaps. Other recommendations welcom.
