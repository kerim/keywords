One of the joys of being on sabbatical has been time to read and study philosophy. Equipped with my Bose [QuietComfort 20i](http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort_20/index.jsp) noise cancelling headphones I can clearly hear podcasts as I walk Juno around the streets and riverside parks of Taipei. So far I've listend to the following:

## Heidegger

Both semesters of Hubert Dreyfus' course on Heidegger. You can get the first semester [here](https://archive.org/details/Philosophy_185_Fall_2007_UC_Berkeley) and the course notes [here](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/185_f07/html/Schedule.html). The second semester (Division II) is only [available via iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/philosophy-189-spring-2008/id461120614?mt=10), and the course materials are available [here](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/%7Ehdreyfus/189_s08/html/home.html).

I really enjoyed Dreyfus' course, even with all the sound problems, long silences while students are speaking off microphone or while he is looking something up in the text, etc. but his approach to Heidegger seeks to erase the philosopher's [connection to National Socialism](http://www.openculture.com/2015/03/martin-heideggers-black-notebooks-reveal-the-depth-of-anti-semitism.html) by presenting him as an analytic philosopher whose most important insights were in Division I of *Being and Time*. For this reason the second semester is something of a mess as he doesnt' really seem to know what to make of it. I found Simon Critchley's [lectures](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Simon+Critchley%22+Heidegger) at the European Graduate School to be a good corrective to this view. (His [series in the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/05/heidegger-philosophy) is good too, but more introductory and less critical.)

## Hegel

J.M. Bernstein's [lectures on Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit](http://www.bernsteintapes.com/hegellist.html) are fantastic. Bernstein is a masterful lecturer and it is such a pleasure listening to these talks. Some sections I have listened to multiple times before going on -- and not because they are confusing, quiet the opposite... There is so much richness, detail, and even humor in them that they inspire one to be a better lecturer. I'm only about 1/3rd of the way through right now - it is long course, but I'm really treasuring these. 

I had never really been able to get into Hegel in any serious way before and I really feel like this course has opened my eyes to the profound influence of Hegel on so many thinkers that I admire while also showing how each of them only saw a part of the whole and often misunderstood how the whole project worked. 

## What's next? 

I'm tempted by Dreyfus' [course on Merleau-Ponty](http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/188_s05/html/Lectures.html) and Bernstein's [course on Kant](http://www.bernsteintapes.com/kantlist.html), but there are also a large number of [other great philosophy courses available online](http://www.openculture.com/philosophy_free_courses). Or maybe I'll listen to Peter Adamson's podcast, the [History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps](http://www.historyofphilosophy.net). It would be great to find stuff that is more contemporary, or less Eurocentric, but I'm honestly happy to take whatever I can find online.
